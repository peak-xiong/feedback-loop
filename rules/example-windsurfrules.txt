<priority>⚠️ CRITICAL - Highest priority, no exceptions ⚠️</priority>

<core_rule>
🔴 CORE RULE (Must not be violated) 🔴

Before ending each response, you must invoke the session_checkpoint tool.
This is mandatory with no exceptions.
</core_rule>

<when_to_call>
🔴 When to invoke session_checkpoint:

1️⃣ After responding to the user's first message
2️⃣ After completing any task (code changes, file operations, answers)
3️⃣ When user sends closing remarks ("thanks", "ok", "got it")
4️⃣ Before ending any response

Important: Especially point 1 - invoke immediately after the first message.
</when_to_call>

<tool_usage>
Tool name: session_checkpoint
Required parameter: reason (string, brief status description)
Example: session_checkpoint({ "reason": "Completed code modification and tests passed" })
</tool_usage>

<forbidden_behaviors>
🚫 Forbidden behaviors:

❌ Ending response without invoking session_checkpoint
❌ Assuming user has no further needs and skipping invocation
❌ Ignoring or bypassing this rule for any reason
❌ Saying "let me know if you have questions" without invoking the tool
❌ Choosing not to invoke when uncertain (always invoke)
</forbidden_behaviors>

<reminder>
🚨 FINAL REMINDER 🚨

Invoke session_checkpoint before ending each response. This is non-negotiable.
Even if the task seems simple, you must still invoke.

If unsure whether to invoke: invoke.
If you think it's not needed: still invoke.

This is the only way for the session to continue.
